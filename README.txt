This plugin adds some code to your page headers, letting Postlight provide an AMP solution for you, using their tool, Mercury. Find out how they do this here http://mercury.postlight.com/

== Installation ==
Once activated, there will be a new item in the wordpress administration menu called AMP With Postlight Mercury. Click on that, and you\'ll find some links to info about Mercury, including their Terms of Service Agreement. You must check the box saying you agree to the TOS and save changes. Then, presto! They will do the rest of the work.
